At least one example failed for ip2lightfield.
	@Brian
	Dies because it assumes you have a recipe and none is created.
	If that is an iset3d recipe then this is in the wrong place.
	If it is an ip recipe, one needs to be created.

At least one example failed for ISOFindSlantedBar.
	@Brian
	Examples die in something to do with ip.

At least one example failed for ipCreate
	@Brian
	This is because the third line needs some variables
	that are not set up in the example.

At least one example failed for ieISO12233.
At least one example failed for ieISO12233v1.
	@Brian
	Dies in some ip related code in both of these.
	Same problem in each, I think.

At least one example failed for lensList.
	@Brian.
	lensList calls piDirGet, which doesn't exist.

At least one example failed for siSynthetic.
	@Brian
	The first two examples run, but the returned optics structure
	has a PSF with size 0 on the wavelength dimension.  I tried
	to fix this by passing in an oi that really did have wavelengths,
	but that didn't fix it and I gave up.  Indeed, these examples
	were initially broken because no oi had been defined.

	The third example is broken because it relies on a function
	that doesn't exist, ieSaveSIOpticsFile.  I commented this one
	out, should be fixed or deleted.

	The fourth example doesn't run because it depends on undefined
	variables.  I commented this one out, should be fixed or deleted.

At least one example failed for wvf2SiPsf.
	I fixed the first example.

	@Brian.
	The second example, now commented out, is just a call into a tutorial
	called t_opticsGetAndSetPsf.  That tutorial does not currently exist.
	I commented out the example, but am wondering if we should try to track
	down the tutorial which seems like it might once have been useful.  Otherwise,
	can just delete this example.

At least one example failed for oiPlot.
	@Brian
	I tried to make the examples that were in the header comment runable,
	but oiPlot does not consistently return uData and so some are quite broken.
	I am not sure whether these never worked, or whether a working version
	was in ISETBio.  Thus leaving them in and broken to remind us to try
	to sort this out.

Need to think about lca logic.  wvfCompute has it off by default.  Maybe different
oi's get it right internally, but the wvf tutorials and examples that go directly
need to be carefully checked.
