Need to think about lca logic.  wvfCompute has it off by default.  Maybe different
oi's get it right internally, but the wvf tutorials and examples that go directly
need to be carefully checked.

At least one example failed for macbethCompareIdeal.
	@Brian,
	The example croaks in something related to ip.

At least one example failed for macbethSelect.
	@Brian.
        Several examples broken, some related to ip,
	some related to simpler errors in arg passing,
	I think.

	Note that examples that start with vcGetObject('sensor')
	and indeed vcGetObject('anything') don't work because
	vcGetObject returns empty when the example is run
	in a clean workspace.  I have been trying to rewrite
	these with a call to the appropriate create, but when
	haven't been systematic about that yet.
	
At least one example failed for sensorDemosaic.
	@Brian
	Error in ip routines.

At least one example failed for sensorReadMosaic.
	@Brian
	Example calls snesorIMX363(), but that function
        does not exist.

At least one example failed for sensorSet.
	@Brian
        I got most of the examples to work, but one relies
	on a parameter whose value isn't clear to me.  I
	left that as its own example with an ETTBSkip, but
        should probably be fixed or just deleted.

        %{
            % ETTBSkip
            % This doesn't work because we don't know what baseName should be.
            sensor = sensorCreate; 
            sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'sensor compute method',baseName);
        %}

At least one example failed for sensorStats.
	@Brian
	Routine sensorStats() itself appears broken in a call to something
	called ieAppGet.  It may be that more args need to be passed in the
        example - when I got to it, it was being called with no args at all
        and wasn't working for lack of a passed sensor.

        Once the first example is fixed, the subsequent ones will need to
        be expanded so that they run in a clean workspace.  Test by using
        clear before running each.

	sensor = sensorCreate;
        [stats, sensor, theRect] = sensorStats(sensor);
        Error using ieAppGet
        Undefined sensor app

        Error in ieROISelect (line 50)
[       app, appAxis] = ieAppGet(obj);

        Error in sensorStats (line 66)
        [~,roiRectangle] = ieROISelect(sensor);

At least one example failed for autoExposure.
	@Brian.  
	Second example works.  First and third fail for reasons having
	something to do with ROI selection and/or cropping.

At least one example failed for imageMakeMontage.
        @Brian
        I got the example to work by defining variable hc as
	a random image.  But I think with a little work and
        some comments, the example could be made to be more helpful.

At least one example failed for ipPlot.
	#Brian
	ip related error in imageSet.

At least one example failed for plotDisplayColor.
	@Brian
	ROI related to error, and code seems connected to ip.

At least one example failed for plotSensorHistogram.
	@Brian
	This routine is expecting some sort of setup before it is called, and that
	setup isn't done by the example.

At least one example failed for sensorPlot.
	@Brian
	The simple code at the start of the example fails.

        The problem here and with many others may be that
	imageSet is shadowed

	>> which imageSet -all
	/Applications/MATLAB_R2023b.app/toolbox/vision/vision/imageSet.m  % imageSet constructor
	/Users/dhb/Documents/MATLAB/toolboxes/isetcam/imgproc/imageSet.m  % Shadowed


At least one example failed for rtGeometry.
	@Brian
	Something not specified here, but not immediately clear to me what.

	scene = sceneCreate('gridlines');
  	oi = oiCreate; %vcGetObject('oi');
  	oi = rtGeometry(oi,scene);
  	imageSPD(gImage);

	Error using rtGeometry
	Insufficient image height data
