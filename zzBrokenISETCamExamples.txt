At least one example failed for chartCornerpoints.
	@Brian:
	Camera code in here is broken.  This set of
	lines fails in the second example.

	scene = sceneCreate;  camera = cameraCreate('default');
  	camera = cameraCompute(camera,scene);

At least one example failed for ieDrawShape.
	@Brian:
	Looks like same issue as in chartCornrpoints above.

At least one example failed for ieROIDraw.
	@Brian
	Three examples fail with this error:

	Error using ieAppGet
	Undefined ip app

	Error in ieROIDraw (line 87)
	[~,ax] = ieAppGet(isetobj);

At least one example failed for ieROISelect.
	@Brian
	Examples fail in ways that seem related to ROIs.

At least one example failed for Demosaic.
	@Brian
	Examples fail in cameraCommpute and/or ipSet. 

At least one example failed for ipGet.
	@Brian
	ipGet unhappy for reasons I'm not sure of.

At least one example failed for ipMCCXYZ.
	@Brian
	Dies in call to macbethSelect.

At least one example failed for ip2lightfield.
	@Brian
	Dies because it assumes you have a recipe and none is created.
	If that is an iset3d recipe then this is in the wrong place.
	If it is an ip recipe, one needs to be created.

At least one example failed for ISOFindSlantedBar.
	@Brian
	Examples die in something to do with ip.

At least one example failed for ipCreate
	@Brian
	This is because the third line needs some variables
	that are not set up in the example.

At least one example failed for ieISO12233.
At least one example failed for ieISO12233v1.
	@Brian
	Dies in some ip related code in both of these.
	Same problem in each, I think.
