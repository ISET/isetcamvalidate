Need to think about lca logic.  wvfCompute has it off by default.  Maybe different
oi's get it right internally, but the wvf tutorials and examples that go directly
need to be carefully checked.

	Note that examples that start with vcGetObject('sensor')
	and indeed vcGetObject('anything') don't work because
	vcGetObject returns empty when the example is run
	in a clean workspace.  I have been trying to rewrite
	these with a call to the appropriate create, but when
	haven't been systematic about that yet.
	


At least one example failed for ieROISelect.
	@Brian
	There was a typo in the skip commands, which I fixed.
	But all of the examples fail when I try to run them by 
	hand.  In some cases, a variable isn't defined.  This 
	is typically because it was defined in an earlier
	example, but we don't want to count on examples being
	run in order - each should execute from a clean workspace.
	But I don't think that is the only issue.

At least one example failed for ipPlot.
	@Brian
	Dies in ieAppGet
	Error using ieAppGet

	Undefined ip app

	Error in ieROIDraw (line 91)
	[~,ax] = ieAppGet(isetobj);

	Error in plotDisplayLine (line 64)
       	 ieROIDraw(ip,'shape','line','shape data',[1 sz(2) xy(2) xy(2)]);

	Error in ipPlot (line 63)
        	[uData, hdl] = plotDisplayLine(ip,'h',xy);

At least one example failed for macbethSelect.
	@Brian
	There are a bunch of examples in this file.  I tried maybe
	the first four, each of which failed for a reason that
	wasn't immediately obvious to me.

At least one example failed for sceneVernier.
	@Brian
	Args are getting messed up by the time sceneCreate calls into sceneVernier.
	By the time we get to the line that throws the error, the variable
	c has value 'display' rather than something numeric.

At least one example failed for sceneHarmonic.
	@Brian
	Examples call sceneInit and sceneComplete, neither of which exist.

At least one example failed for lensList.
	@Brian
	>>    lensNames = lensList;   
	Unrecognized function or variable 'piDirGet'.

	Error in lensList (line 57)
	files = dir(fullfile(piDirGet('lens'),star));

At least one example failed for oiPlot.
	@Brian
	This was broken becaues the call to 
		uData = oiPlot(oi,'irradiance energy roi');
	died with this error message:
		Error using ieAppGet
		Undefined oi app

		Error in ieROISelect (line 54)
		[app, appAxis] = ieAppGet(obj);

		Error in oiPlot (line 161)
            		roiLocs = ieROISelect(oi);
	I just commented out that line in the example
	with a comment that it is broken.  My guess
	is that some gui needs to have been opened
	for this to be able to work, but leaving the
	details to you.  Or if this isn't an interesting
	use case, could just delete from the example
	altogether.
