Need to think about lca logic.  wvfCompute has it off by default.  Maybe different
oi's get it right internally, but the wvf tutorials and examples that go directly
need to be carefully checked.

	Note that examples that start with vcGetObject('sensor')
	and indeed vcGetObject('anything') don't work because
	vcGetObject returns empty when the example is run
	in a clean workspace.  I have been trying to rewrite
	these with a call to the appropriate create, but when
	haven't been systematic about that yet.
