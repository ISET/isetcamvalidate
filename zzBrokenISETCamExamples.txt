Need to think about lca logic.  wvfCompute has it off by default.  Maybe different
oi's get it right internally, but the wvf tutorials and examples that go directly
need to be carefully checked.

	Note that examples that start with vcGetObject('sensor')
	and indeed vcGetObject('anything') don't work because
	vcGetObject returns empty when the example is run
	in a clean workspace.  I have been trying to rewrite
	these with a call to the appropriate create, but when
	haven't been systematic about that yet.
	


Failure cases (12)
At least one example failed for ieROISelect.
At least one example failed for lensList.
At least one example failed for wvfComputeConePSF.
At least one example failed for macbethSelect.
At least one example failed for sceneHarmonic.
At least one example failed for sceneVernier.
At least one example failed for sceneAdjustLuminance.
At least one example failed for sensorMacbethDaylightEstimate.
At least one example failed for ipPlot.


At least one example failed for oiPlot.
	@Brian
	This was broken becaues the call to 
		uData = oiPlot(oi,'irradiance energy roi');
	died with this error message:
		Error using ieAppGet
		Undefined oi app

		Error in ieROISelect (line 54)
		[app, appAxis] = ieAppGet(obj);

		Error in oiPlot (line 161)
            		roiLocs = ieROISelect(oi);
	I just commented out that line in the example
	with a comment that it is broken.  My guess
	is that some gui needs to have been opened
	for this to be able to work, but leaving the
	details to you.  Or if this isn't an interesting
	use case, could just delete from the example
	altogether.
