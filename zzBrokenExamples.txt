Failure cases (21)
At least one example failed for bipolarMosaic.
At least one example failed for bipolarSet.
At least one example failed for visualize.
At least one example failed for movieHex.
At least one example failed for plotHexMeanImage.
At least one example failed for conePlot.
At least one example failed for selectPlotSupport.

** At least one example failed for coneMosaicHex.

DHB: Almost go this to work by changing coneMosaic -> coneMosaicRect.
But there is still an problem with the window method not recognizing
'show'.

We are going to fix this by making coneMosaicHex go away.

** At least one example failed for emGenSequence.

DHB: I don't get it.  There are no examples in this file.

** At least one example failed for oisCreate.

DHB: Problem seems to be in calls to scene things.   Probably
some sort of isetbio/isetcam incompatiability.

** At least one example failed for humanOI.

DHB: The example fails because there is no opticsSet for 'spectrum'.
There is a comment in humanOI that the whole spectrum concept
is suspect. In any case, I don't know what the optics spectrum
might be.

** At least one example failed for visualizePSFfromOI.

DHB: Seems like a problem with opticsGet not being compatible with the way it was.

fSupport and nSamps required.

Error in visualizePSFfromOI (line 48)
