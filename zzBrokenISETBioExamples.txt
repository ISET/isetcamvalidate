** At least one example failed for oisCreate.

DHB: Problem seems to be in calls to scene things.   Probably
some sort of isetbio/isetcam incompatiability.

** At least one example failed for humanOI.

DHB: The example fails because there is no opticsSet for 'spectrum'.
There is a comment in humanOI that the whole spectrum concept
is suspect. In any case, I don't know what the optics spectrum
might be.

** At least one example failed for visualizePSFfromOI.

DHB: Seems like a problem with opticsGet not being compatible with the way it was.

fSupport and nSamps required.

Error in visualizePSFfromOI (line 48)
    psfSupportMicrons = opticsGet(optics,'psf support','um');

** At least one example failed for ijspeert.


DHB: I fixed this in the isetcam version.  Need to decide whether to keep 
isetcam or isetbio, and if the latter move the fix over.
