** At least one example failed for humanOI.  Be sure to fix the
version we decide to keep (isetcam/isetbio).

DHB: The example fails because there is no opticsSet for 'spectrum'.
There is a comment in humanOI that the whole spectrum concept
is suspect. In any case, I don't know what the optics spectrum
might be.

** At least one example failed for visualizePSFfromOI.

DHB: Seems like a problem with opticsGet not being compatible with the way it was.
    clear; close all;
    oi = oiCreate('wvf human');

    visualizePSFfromOI(oi,300,'displayPSFCenterOfMass',true);
Error using opticsGet
fSupport and nSamps required.

** At least one example failed for ijspeert.
   At least one example failed for humanConeContrast.
   At least one example failed for humanConeIsolating.


DHB: I fixed this in the isetcam version.  Need to decide whether to keep 
isetcam or isetbio, and if the latter move the fixes over.

** At least one example failed for oisCreate.

DHB:

Second example: sceneCreate calls sceneVernier, but there is no sceneVernier.
My guess is that we need to bring sceneVernier over from isetbio.

Third example: Looks like some sceneSet incompatibility:

>>  % Impulse (temporal)
    clear iparams
    sparams.fov = 1;
    sparams.luminance = 100;
    stimWeights = zeros(1, 50);
    stimWeights(2:4) = 1;
    impulse = oisCreate('impulse', 'add', stimWeights, ...
        'sceneParameters', sparams);
    impulse.visualize('movie illuminance');
Error using sceneSet
Lminance array does not match photon array size.

Error in oisCreate (line 243)
                        scene{jj} = sceneSet(scene{jj}, fields{ii}, val);
