% Compute psfs for the Hofer sample data
%
% HH provided Zernike coefficients measured in 9 subjects.  We compute the
% psfs using these, and look at a slice through each of them.  We try
% things various different ways.
%
% The computed PSFs are recentered, with their maximum in the center, so
% that we see the real peak when we take the 1D slice.
%
% This also optimizes the defocus to maximize the strehl ratio for each
% subject, so you can see the (large) effect of doing that.
%
% Note from DHB.  Again, I don't know if these are correct, but at least
% you can see that you get a wide range of answers by using different
% subjects' data.
%
% Note from HH: Surprised by the large changes with the 3mm pupil between
% zero defocus and that required to optimize the strehl.   Ran it with
% calcpupil of 6mm (since already had lots of calculations done for these
% subjects at this size) and with or without the SCE the values of defocus
% required to optimize the monochromatic strehl matched my calculations- at
% least within the resolution of your routine, so I guess the 3mm result is
% just what happens.  Not exactly an independent test, but at least
% verifies that these routines produce the same result as my original
% function.
%
% Note from HH: For real calculations, using a defocus increment smaller
% than 0.25 Diopters would be wise.
