# isetcamvalidate
Separating the validation code and data into their own separate repository.

We write a lot of unit and system tests for ISETCam. Historically, we kept the validation scripts and data in ISETCam itself.

By moving the code and data for validation into a separate repository, we believe we will feel librated to expand the validation. We will not have to touch ISETCam itself, and we will be able to see the whole set of validation scripts and data more clearly. 

At least, that's the hope and why this repository exists.
